## Refinement Plan and Code Review

---

In the code review videos, I analyzed the three selected artifacts code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explained my plan for enhancements. The code review is a walk-through of the existing source code and planned improvements to software design and engineering artifacts, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Through the developed videos, I continue advancing my abilities to deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communication techniques to effectively explain a code review through collaborative environments that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. In the artifact code analysis, I demonstrate the critical elements of:

* Existing functionality: A detailed walk-through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the current code.
* Code Analysis: Target areas of improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.
* Enhancements: A walk-through of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancements

The artifact selected for the software design and engineering code review is the **Inventory Mobile App**. The application was planned, designed, and developed as part of the computer science course CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The app's goal is to track an inventory of items using a mobile device. I developed the mobile app in the JAVA programming language with integration to SQLite database language. The enhancement planned to implement is to complete the user CRUD actions in the item's activity. Improve the functionality and efficiency of the SQLHelper class methods. Give a mechanism to the user to recover their password in case of forgetting.

### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancements

The code review in algorithms and data structure is the artifact of the **Zoo Monitoring System Program**. The program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the IT145 Foundation in Application Development computer science course. The program aims to create an authentication system that manages authentication and authorization for zookeeper users and administrators. The program is developed in the JAVA programming language running in the NetBeans internal terminal console.

The enhancement planned to implement is to complete a zoo monitor system based on the development of a pseudocode in which I illustrate the integration of the authentication and authorization system with the monitor system. Develop a set of dashboards where a zookeeper can know the activities of the animals in their care and monitor their living habitats. Give the authenticated and authorized user the selection to monitor an animal, monitor a habitat, manage the user authorized in the system, or exit the program according to their role. Displays a list of animal/habitat options reading from either an animals file or habitats file.

### Databases Enhancements

The code review in databases is the artifact of **Salvare Search for Rescue Web Application**. The web app was planned, designed, and developed for the CS340 Client-Server Development computer science course. The application aims to create a web interface that works with an existing database from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs to train for different rescues. The application is developed in Python with the Dash framework and the non-relational database MongoDB. Python and MongoDB are integrated through the use of the PyMongo driver. Jupyter Notebook is used as a test tool to run the web application.

The planned enhancement is to recreate the web application in a Windows environment. I initially developed the application in the Apporto Virtual Lab, a university remote desktop Linux platform. Using the application documentation, follow the guidance on how to recreate the web application environment and update/revise the documentation according to the actions executed to replicate and run the web application on a Windows terminal.

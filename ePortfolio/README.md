## Overview

This repository documents my procedures for developing my ePortfolio as the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project. Creating a professional portfolio that showcases my unique abilities and talents is one of the best visual communication tools to demonstrate our value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clear ideas that showcase my skills across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifacts of some of the courses in the Computer Science Program represent my growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

Some artifacts could demonstrate my skills in one category and illustrate skills across other key categories. As an own program practice, the artifacts chosen have been enhanced and presented beyond the course requirements, establishing a quality of work, addressing their limitations or inconsistencies, and mitigating vulnerabilities. The portfolio conveys the impression that I am strongly motivated, well organized, and accomplished in Computer Science major in Software Engineering.

### Self-Reflections

[Journal: Self-Introduction](CS499/CS499-M1-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Self-Introduction")

This paper is an informative self-introduction related to the computer science courses concepts applicable to my personal experiences. It is about sharing personal opinions and viewpoints and engaging with course concepts and materials deeper, more reflective.

[Journal: Career Choice](CS499/CS499-M4-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Career Choice")

This paper reflects on my career choice and plans for the future due to the Computer Science program. It recalls why I have remained more consistent in my career plans and how my thinking about my career has evolved. I comment on some research about my career choices and how this has impacted my thinking.

[Journal: Capstone Reflection](CS499/CS499-M7-1_Paper.pdf "Journal: Capstone Reflection")

This paper is a course submission reflection of my journey through the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course assignments. I discuss how I reached the five-course outcomes by enhancing the included artifacts in my ePortfolio, and the accomplishment of creating a professional ePortfolio that showcases my knowledge, skills, and abilities from the Computer Science program.

### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

[ePortfolio Initial Plan](CS499/CS499-M1-4_Paper.pdf "ePortfolio Initial Plan")<br/>
[ePortfolio Wireframe](CS499/CS499-M1-4_Wireframe.pdf "ePortfolio Wireframe")

This paper is an initial plan describing how I meet the ePortfolio requirements. While the plan submitted was not final, it is a solid starting point with clear ideas for review. This assignment may be seen as a way of beginning a conversation that results in a challenging but practical plan to produce an ePortfolio that showcases my skills across the key fields of computer science:

* Software engineering and design
* Algorithms and data structure
* Databases

### Code Review

[Software Design and Engineering Artifact](https://youtu.be/_bghpjLhfNQ?rel=0 "Software Design and Engineering Artifact Code Review Video")<br/>
[Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact](https://youtu.be/UvBW0RyhuZw?rel=0 "Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact Code Review Video")<br/>
[Databases Artifact](https://youtu.be/Ct7p3I_X9U0?rel=0 "Databases Artifact Code Review Video")

I perform a code review in a video for each artifact selected in my initial plan. In this code review, I analyze existing code for weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities and explain my plan for enhancements. These code reviews are a walk-through of existing code and planned enhancements, and it demonstrates the following critical elements for each category:

* Existing functionality: A detailed walk-through of the existing code focused on the features and function of the current code.
* Code Analysis: Target areas of improvement in structure, logic, efficiency, functionality, security, testing, commenting, and documenting.
* Enhancements: A walk-through of planned enhancements that address issues raised in the code analysis.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

[Software Design and Engineering Narrative](CS499/CS499-M3-2_Paper.pdf "Software Design and Engineering - Inventory Mobile App")

This paper is a narrative that accompanies the artifact enhancements for software design and engineering. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of our ePortfolio and reflects on the process used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses on the learning that happened through the artifact's creation. The artifact demonstrates our ability to use innovative skills and techniques for implementing design solutions and accomplishing goals. The ability to program solutions to solve software logic problems and address potential design flaws related to security.

### Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement

[Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative](CS499/CS499-M4-2_Paper.pdf "Algorithms and Data Structure - Zoo Monitor System Program")

This paper is a narrative that accompanies the artifact enhancements for algorithms and data structure. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of our ePortfolio and reflects on the process used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses on the learning that happened through the artifact's creation. The artifact consists of design considerations to authenticate and authorize a user into the monitor system based on user credentials and the accountability of the user interaction with different modules screen and actions according to their role in the monitor system.

### Databases Enhancement

[Databases Narrative](CS499/CS499-M5-2_Paper.pdf "Databases - Salvare Search for Rescue Web App")</br>
[Web Application Demo](https://youtu.be/r9EonyBs9I8?rel=0 "Salvare Search for Rescue Web App - Demo")

This paper is a narrative that accompanies the artifact enhancements for databases. It explains why the selected artifact was included in this category of our ePortfolio and reflects on the process used to create the artifact. The narrative focuses on the learning that happened through the artifact's creation. The artifact involved a multi-tier application with a Model View Controller (MVC) and RESTful protocol design to extend the HTTP protocol to provide an application programming interface (API). The most attractive concept of the MVC pattern is a separation of concerns.

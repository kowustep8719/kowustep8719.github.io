In the enhanced code artifact, sensitive user data, such as passwords, is securely stored within the SQLite database. The use of parameterized queries and prepared statements in database interactions helps prevent SQL injection attacks, mitigating potential vulnerabilities in the software architecture.

Throughout the process, I ensured adherence to established computer science practices, resulting in the successful design and evaluation of computing solutions within mobile app development. Employing user-centered design principles demonstrates my skills in utilizing established and inventive methodologies, expertise, and technologies within computing to create computer solutions that add value and achieve industry-specific objectives. I also employed the best coding standard practices to enhance the code's readability, maintainability, and comprehensibility, making it easier for other developers to read and improving the organization of the application code. By incorporating proper in-line comment conventions throughout the codebase, indentation, and proper code formatting, I ensured that developers could easily jump in and understand each component's purpose, functionality, usage, method, and class. These comments serve as valuable documentation, guiding developers through the intricacies of the code and facilitating collaboration among team members.

The artifact selected for the databases is the Traveler Website, as demonstrated in the [artifact code review](CodeReview "Refinement Plan and Code Review"). This traveler website was created during my computer science course, CS-465: Full Stack Development I. I took this course in the year 2023. The website was developed using the JavaScript application, which uses the Node.js runtime environment with the Express framework for the back-end and the Angular framework for the front-end. I also used HTML and CSS to structure the content on the travel website pages. The application combines both Node.js (for the back-end) and Angular (for the front-end), making it a MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack application. It also integrates with MongoDB using Mongoose for database operations.

I added the traveler website artifact to my ePortfolio because it demonstrates several valuable skills and competencies in databases to potential employers, recruiters, or educational institutions. Also, I added this artifact to my ePortfolio because I would like to effectively showcase my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and creativity to potential employers to increase my chances of hiring. The integrated authentication mechanisms, RESTful API consumption, and dynamic content rendering demonstrate my ability to create functional and secure web applications tailored for real-world scenarios, which employers always want to see from their employees. Upon running the travel website, the Angular Live Development Server initiates and starts listening on localhost:4200, prompting users to open their browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The server compiles successfully, generating the necessary files for the web application to function correctly. The application fetches data from the MongoDB database as the server runs, triggering HTTP GET requests to retrieve trip information. Each request is processed, and the corresponding trips are fetched and displayed on the website.

The enhancement of the artifact aligns closely with the course objective of developing a security mindset in software development, as it encompasses various security measures and considerations aimed at safeguarding data and resources against potential threats and exploits. This objective is achieved by implementing rigorous data validation, securing database access, promoting code reusability, adapting security measures within the travel website, and enhancing data and resource security. For example, the website employs secure password storage techniques, such as hashing and salting, to protect user passwords stored in the database. By using these encryption methods, the website ensures that even if the database is compromised, the actual passwords remain secure and cannot be easily decrypted.

I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts." This was accomplished by effectively documenting the development process of the travel website, including clear and concise explanations of the codebase, system architecture, and implementation details. For example, the README.md file in the repository for the traveler website provides comprehensive documentation that outlines the project's purpose, features, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. This documentation is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy for stakeholders, collaborators, or future developers to understand the project and its components. Additionally, comments within the source code itself serve as documentation explaining the purpose and functionality of specific functions, classes, or modules. These comments are written in a technically sound manner, using appropriate terminology and language conventions to ensure coherence and clarity.

I demonstrated my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals." This is achieved by leveraging specific modern web development tools and frameworks, such as Angular for the front end and Node.js with Express for the back-end. By incorporating industry-standard practices and innovative techniques, I created a functional and user-friendly travel website that meets the specific goals of the travel industry, showcasing my mastery of these modern technologies. 

I was able to design and evaluate computing solutions by developing the CRUD module for handling database records. This required strategic decision-making and adherence to computer science practices and standards, demonstrating my ability to make informed choices and manage design trade-offs. I achieved this objective by carefully designing the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) module to ensure that it efficiently handles database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

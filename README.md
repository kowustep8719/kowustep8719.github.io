### ePortfolio Selection and Software Design Document

[CS499/CS499_Module1-4_Artifact.pdf](CS499/CS499_Module1-2_Artifact.pdf "ePortfolio Artifact Selection")

This document outlines my preliminary strategy for fulfilling the ePortfolio criteria. The submitted plan is an excellent place to start with well-defined ideas for review, even though it did not constitute the final work. It served as a guide to ensure that my plan encompassed each rubric requirement effectively. In formulating this plan, I carefully considered the artifacts I would enhance for the final project, drawing from my previous coursework. These artifacts served as the foundation for showcasing my skills across the three computer science categories specified in the guidelines.
